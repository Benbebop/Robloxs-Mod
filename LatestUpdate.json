	{"title":"Updates!","content":"Fixed the Latest Update System. Instead of reading the Roblox Update System, which other people cant, it now uses the Roblox's Mod Github Repository. This means it might not be changed for every update, I cant trust myself to do that, but at least it works. \n\nWork has been postponed quite a-bit recently with the combustion of my computer's PSU, still working on it but just on my laptop. \n\nIn the background im rewritting the addon editor, so expect that to come soon.","date":[2021,2,18]}
